Desc : shopping cart made with react and react router dom , used framer motion for the animations , it has a Navbar with the number of items purchased next to the cart icon , the catalogue is fetched from the Fortnine API , you can increment and decrement the number of items bought from the catalogue and the cart , i used lifted states to send the data between components .
You can also sign in / sign up , and log out  , i added auththeication using firebase , and used the context provider pattern wich make the code wayy cleaner and extremely modular , featuring an AuthProvider component , that handles all the logic and pass the values to any component wrapped within it .
